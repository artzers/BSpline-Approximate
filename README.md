# BSpline-Approximate

The purpose of this software is obtaining a smooth spline curve which passes through a set of (X,Y) data points provided. This set of (X,Y) data points are knot points instead of control points.

It is noted that the smooth curve generated by our code is open curve. If close curve is needed, please check https://github.com/QianZheng/BSplineFitting
